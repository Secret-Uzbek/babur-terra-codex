## About

Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur (1483–1530) was not simply an emperor. He was a geopolitical node from which empires and revolutions grew. His synthesis gave birth to India. The British destruction of this synthesis created Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Kashmir conflict. His tea caused the creation of America. His architecture inspired billions.

**Babur-Terra Codex** is a 13-module fractal analysis of Babur's legacy — from Ferghana exile to modern geopolitics — built on the Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP).

## Language Strategy

This project practices **epistemic decolonization**: documents are published in the languages of those who lived this history, not just those who documented it from outside.

| Tier | Languages | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Core | Uzbek, Urdu, Hindi | ✅ v1.0-draft |
| Bridge | English, Russian | 🔄 in progress |
| Heritage | Chagatai, Persian | 📋 planned |

See [LANGUAGE-STRATEGY.md](LANGUAGE-STRATEGY.md) for full rationale.

## Integration with FMP Ecosystem

This project is part of the **Fractal Metascience Paradigm** ecosystem:

- **UST** (Universal Semantic Translator) — connective tissue enabling cross-corpus analysis
- **Navoi Semantic Corpus** — literary precedent (Babur grew up reading Navoi)
- **Fractal Silk Road** — modern policy application of Babur's geopolitical legacy

## ⚠️ Translation Note

Current manifests are v1.0-draft. **Native speaker review required** for all three languages (uz/ur/hi). If you are a linguist or subject expert, please submit corrections via Pull Request.
